# Alarm Clock

This Python project implements a simple alarm clock using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The objective is to create an alarm clock that allows users to set alarms for specific times in a 24-hour format.

## Modules

### Tkinter
Tkinter is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is commonly used for developing graphical user interfaces. In this project, Tkinter is utilized to create the graphical interface for setting the alarm time.

### Winsound
The winsound module provides access to sound-playing functionality on Windows platforms. It is used in this project to play a sound when the alarm is triggered.

### time
The time module in Python provides various time-related functions. In this project, it is used to introduce delays and synchronize the alarm triggering.

### datetime
The datetime module focuses on simplifying access to attributes associated with dates, times, and time zones. It is used for handling and parsing time-related information in this alarm clock project.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the Python script (e.g., `python alarm_clock.py`).
2. A dialog box will appear, presenting a user interface to set the alarm time.
3. Enter the desired hour, minutes, and seconds for the alarm.
