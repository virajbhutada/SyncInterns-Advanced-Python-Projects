        "**Description:**\n",
        "This project showcases the creation of a rule-based chatbot using natural language processing techniques. The chatbot is designed to respond intelligently to user queries based on predefined rules, providing valuable insights into natural language understanding and conversation dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the implementation, the first step involves importing essential libraries, including 're' for regular expressions, which facilitates pattern matching within the chatbot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following that, a set of predefined rules is established, covering various user inputs such as greetings, inquiries, and goodbyes. Each rule is associated with specific patterns and corresponding responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core functionality is encapsulated in the simple_chatbot function, which takes user input, utilizes regular expressions to match predefined rules, and generates appropriate responses based on the established patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "To enhance user interaction, an interactive conversation function and conversation loop are implemented. This allows users to engage in a dynamic conversation with the chatbot, featuring logic for exiting the conversation, restarting, and handling diverse user inputs within the conversation loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project not only provides a practical demonstration of rule-based chatbot development but also serves as a foundational exploration for more advanced conversational agents."
